                        <p>
                            This chrome extension is for use internally on a time clock web page. If you don't know what it's for, it's probably not for you.

                        <h3>Download and Installation</h3>

                        <h4>Follow these steps precisely</h4>
                        <ol>

                            <li>
                                You need to open your chrome extensions settings page. You can get to this by typing <code>chrome://extensions</code> into the address bar, or currently (Chrome's UI changes a lot)
                                by going to the menu icon at the top right <img src="img/chrome-menu.png" alt="Chrome menu" title="Chrome menu" />, selecting Settings, and then selecting extensions. Good luck!
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Then download the <a href="ntdsrmods-0.45.crx">ntdsrmods-xxx.crx</a> (where xxx is a version) file <strong>to your computer</strong>.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Finally, drag the extension file into the extensions page and you should see the image below. If you don't, it's not going to work and you're going to get a warning about not being able to install from websites. </p>

                                <p><img src="img/chrome-drop-to-install.png" alt="Chrome drop to install" title="Chrome drop to install" /></p>

                                <p><strong>This also will not work if you spawn the settings page into its own window to make it easier.</strong> Google hates you; I'm sorry.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Usage</h3>
                        <h4>What You Should See</h4>
                        <img class="page-action-illustration" src="img/page-action.png" alt="Page Action Illustration" />
                        <h4>Options</h4>
                        <p>
                            Click on Niblet's head to adjust settings. The changes should be reflected immediately in
                            Daily Status tabs. The "Beginning of Day" setting is unused right now, but set it correctly,
                            because it will be used in the future. Enjoy!
