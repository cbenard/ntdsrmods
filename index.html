                        <p>
                            This chrome extension is for use internally on a time clock web page. If you don't know what it's for, it's probably not for you.

                        <h3>Download and Installation</h3>

                        <p>
                            You need to open your chrome extensions settings page. You can get to this by typing <code>chrome://extensions</code> into the address bar, or currently (Chrome's UI changes a lot)
                            by going to the menu icon at the top right <img src="img/chrome-menu.png" alt="Chrome menu" title="Chrome menu" />, selecting Settings, and then selecting extensions. Good luck!
                        </p>

                            Then drag the <a href="ntdsrmods.crx">ntdsrmods.crx</a> file into the extension settings page and allow it to be installed.
