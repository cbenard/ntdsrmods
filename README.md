#Daily Status Modifications

This chrome extension is for use internally on a time clock web page. If you don't know what it's for, it's probably not for you.

##Download and Installation

You need to open your chrome extensions settings page. You can get to this by typing `chrome://extensions`
into the address bar, or currently (Chrome's UI changes a lot) by going to the menu icon at the top right,
selecting Settings, and then selecting extensions. Good luck!

Then drag the `ntdsrmods.crx` file into the extension settings page and allow it to be installed.

##Issues and Suggestions

Pull requests are even more helpful for suggestions, but feel free to talk to me about it first.
