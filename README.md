#Daily Status Modifications `gh-pages` Branch

This chrome extension is for use internally on a time clock web page. If you don't know what it's for, it's probably not for you.

This is the web project branch. You probably want to either be on the <a href="http://cbenard.github.io/ntdsrmods/">project webpage</a> or the <a href="http://github.com/cbenard/ntdsrmods/">repository web page</a>.
